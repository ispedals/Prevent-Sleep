# Prevent Sleep

(Update 3/2017): With the coming deprecation of non Web Extension based addons and that Web Extension cannot make Windows function calls, this addon will stop working in Firefox 57.

Prevents computer from sleeping when downloads are occuring, either global or private.
Currently, this also prevents the display from turning off, which needs to be fixed.
